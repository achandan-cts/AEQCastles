Notes:

Due to the following assumptions:

You can always build a castle at the start of the array, provided it is non-empty


A peak is an integer or series of integers that is above the immediately preceding and following ints. For example, in the sequence [2,6,6,6,3] the sequence of 3 6s is a peak.

The code I have written will not count the end of an array as a castle, even if it is a sequence of equal values.
